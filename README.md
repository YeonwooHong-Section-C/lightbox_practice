# Lightbox Photo Gallery
Photo gallery using flexbox and lightbox with categoty buttons.

# What I learned
-  jQuery filter method 
```
The filter() method returns elements that match a certain criteria.
```

- aspect ratio
```
Define the ratio between width and height of an element.
In responsive layouts where elements often vary in size and you want to preserve the ratio between width and height.
```

- object-fit
```
Resize img or video while preserving that aspect ratio.
Can be used to stretch up and take up as much space as possible.
```
